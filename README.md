# node-hapijs-microservice
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Implementation of a user login microservices that uses ES6 Promise, Hapi.js, Mongodb, and Node.js

Run using nodemon --debug server2.js, then run node-inspector

In the root folder you will need index.js, config.js, db-config.js, and server2.js (optionally server1.js). The login folder contains the login microservice files. 

Use this as a template to build an highly configurable, and loosely coupled application architecture based on microservices. 

<h3>Note</h3>
This is bare bones framework, you will need to add you own endpoint authorization services, etc. I have added code for console and file logging. Log files are rotated.
